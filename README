This is a documentation about all the algorithms i will implement in C for
the course of CEF405: Design and Analysis of Algorithms.

- Implementation of Stack Using Arrays: 
  The first DS i have implemented in the repo is the Stack which i used Arrays. Created a Stack using dynamic memory
  allocation. I calculated the time of run(runtime) using the time command when i ran the program e.g. [time ./call].
  This algorithm implementation is self explanatory and easy to understand.


- Implementation of Merge Sort Using Arrays:
  This is a sorting algorithm that functions using the divide and conquer approach. The program consist of two functions
  Merge() and MergeSort(). Merge() merges the splitted arrays for sorting while the MergeSort() itself does the sorting
  on the merged arrays. This algorithm in the program as implemented is recursive and divides an array e.g. Array into 
  sub arrays for sorting.
