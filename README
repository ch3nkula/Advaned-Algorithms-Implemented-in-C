This is a documentation about all the algorithms i will implement in C for
the course of CEF405: Design and Analysis of Algorithms.

Recursion and Iteration

- Implemented two algorithms using different approaches, One with Recursion(RecursiveFib.c) and the other with
  Iteration(IterFib.c). This two programs are to print the fibonacci series and for the first Algorithm implementation,
  which uses recursion has a run-time of O(b^n) where b = 1.618 and the other(iteration) run at O(n) time complexity.
  The essence of this exercise is to analyse the run-time of the algorithms for good utilisation of memory and time.


Data Structures Using Arrays

- Implementation of Stack Using Arrays: 
  The first DS i have implemented in the repo is the Stack which i used Arrays. Created a Stack using dynamic memory
  allocation. I calculated the time of run(runtime) using the time command when i ran the program e.g. [time ./call].
  This algorithm implementation is self explanatory and easy to understand.


Sorting Algorithms Using Arrays

- Merge Sort:
  This is a sorting algorithm that functions using the divide and conquer approach. The program consist of two functions
  Merge() and MergeSort(). Merge() merges the splitted arrays for sorting while the MergeSort() itself does the sorting
  on the merged arrays. This algorithm in the program as implemented is recursive and divides an array e.g. Array into 
  sub arrays for sorting.

- Shell Sort:
  Shell sort is a sorting algorithms that beats the O(n2) barrier. It is a sorting algorithms similar to insertion sort
  but works with values far from each other i.e. values with greater distances in the array cells. I implemented this
  using arrays for simplicity and easy understanding. This algorithms is efficient than other like: insertion sort, bubble
  sort etc

Brute-Force Algorithms

- 2D-Maxima:
  It is an algorithm meant to count set of points and output the maximum point of the graph using some sort of comparison.
  This program reads set of points from the stdin and computes the maximum point from the set of points.
